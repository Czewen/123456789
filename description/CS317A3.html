Note: You may work in pairs or alone. However, you are strongly encouraged to
work with a partner. We will again be using Stash and partner signup is the
same as in A2 and A1. If you are working alone, which is discouraged, you still
need to signup. The signup instructions for working alone are given as a
comment to the partner signup URL on Connect. Upon signup, we will populate your repo with a
working makefile and a simple main program. Only signup alone if you 
really plan on doing the assignment yourself as you will not be able to 
pair up with someone later. In particular do not  signup alone simply to see
the provided code as it is only a few lines long and is basically a "Hello
World" program to give you and the makefile a starting point.

        </li></ul>


      </div>


    <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

    <p>
      In this assignment you will  initially use the Unix socket API to construction a
      web proxy server. You will then extend the proxy server  
      to block websites. For example, the server, through a provided file, 
      might be configured to block any host name that the substrings <b>SFU</b>, <b>Toronto</b>,
      or <b>uvic.ca</b>.



      </p><p>
      Your program is to take two arguments. The first is the TCP port the program 
      will be listening on for HTTP connections. The second argument is
      the name of a local file containing the substrings identifying host names
      or parts of host names that content is <b>not</b> be retrieved from.  In
      the first part of the assignment the second argument can be ignored.

<!--
      Each string in the filter file is to be on a line by itself. For simplicity, the substrings
      must match exactly, except for case. Again, for simplicity, you only have to use
      the first 20 lines of the file and you can assume no line is longer than 64 characters. Suppose that the file 
      contained, on separate lines, SFU and Toronto then the following would be
      considered matches:
      <ul>
        <li>In basketball the UBC Thunderbirds beat Toronto like a rented mule.
        <li>www.sfu.ca
        <li>TorontoBlueJays
        <li>most torontonians 
      </ul>
-->


      </p><p>Once completed the program will, roughly, do the following:
        </p><ol>
          <li>Listens for connections
          </li><li>Accepts a connection from the client.
          </li><li>Checks the host the URI is to be retrieved from to determine it
            is banned (blacklisted). 
          </li><li>Checks to see if the URL being requested is cached. If so returns 
              the cached contents. Otherwise:
          </li><li>Sets up a connection to the 
            machine identified by the HOST: part of the HTTP request and
            forwards the request and all other data to the host.
           </li><li>Accepts the response data from the server and forwards it to the 
              client and stores it in a cache file. 
            </li><li>Closes the connection and goes back to listening.
          </li></ol>

<p>You are only to cache successfully retrieved data. (e.g. if you get a 404
  don't cache that.) You can also ignore any directives in the response that
  pertain to caching. This means that this proxy server will only work properly
  for plain pages that don't have dynamic content or constraints on how long a
  page can be cached. 

</p><p>
  Your server is to be based on the HTTP/1.1 specification, available
    at: <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">
    http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html</a>. (You can ignore the
  red warning banner.) You are only
    required to implement enough of the protocol to get this assignment working. 
    Essentially that means you need to handle the GET request and the <b>host:</b>
  header field. Since the request is not destined for your proxyServer
  (i.e., your proxyServer  isn't
  responsible for the original content) the full request needs to be
  transparently passed to the target server. Many browsers will request a
  persistent connection, you don't have to honour that. 

</p><p>    To develop a better
    understanding of the problems and how to interpret the HTTP protocol you
should read 2.2 of the text paying particular attention to sections 2.2.1, 2.2.3,
2.2.5, and 2.2.6.



</p><p>The following sections outline the order you are to implement the assignment.
 Do not proceed to the next part of the assignment until you get the
  current part working. In particular note that if you don't have part "N"
  working you will not get any marks for part "N+1".



   </p><h2>Part 1: The Simple Proxy Server</h2>

The goal of the first part of the assignment is to:
<ul>
<li>
  Accept a connection request from a client
</li><li>Parse the request looking for the GET and HOST headers respectively and to
  print the URL to be retrieved and the HOST to contact. If the type of the
  request is not GET your proxy is to return a 405 and indicate that the only 
  method allowed is a GET.
</li><li>To connect to the HOST and forward the HTTP request to that host. Make sure
  to deal with the situation when a host is not reachable or refuses a
  connection. (Checkout the 5xx codes.) 
</li><li>Assuming the  connection is accepted, read and print the HTTP reply code
  before or while sending the response back to the client.
</li><li>Once you have read the all of the response data close the connections to
  both the client and the HTTP server. To do this properly you may have to
  handle  the content-length (14.13) field or responses that 
  have a chunked encoding transfer type (3.6). 
</li><li>Go back and wait for another connection.
</li></ul>

<p> Some suggestions for testing your proxy server:
</p><ul>
 <li>Pick a web site that has very simple content to return. 
 <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~acton/lawler.txt">http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~acton/lawler.txt</a>
          is an example of one file that you should be able to retrieve, but 
   make sure you try other sites. 
 </li><li>Make sure you understand the format of an HTTP is like and then you can
   use telnet or nc commands on the department Linux machines to manually 
   connect to your proxy server and then manually enter the HTTP request. 
</li></ul>

<h2>Part 2: Filtering Hosts</h2>
<p>One of the key tasks of your server is to block sites that appear in the
  filter file (blacklist). Each line in the filter file contains a string that 
is to be looked for in the host the URI is to be retrieved from. If the string
  appears anywhere in the host name then the request is not to be forwarded and
  the proxy server is to return a 403 to client and then close the connection. 

</p><p>You may assume that the file contains no more than 100 entries and that no
  entry is more than 100 characters long. When matching the strings in the file
  against the host name, case is to be ignored and the strings are considered to
  match if the string in the file appears anywhere in the host name. Typical
  pattern matching characters like "*" have not special meaning.


   </p><h2>Part 3: Proxy server that handles multiple clients at the same time</h2>

<p>A proxy server that handles only one connection at a time 
 can be quite the bottleneck so your next task is to make your server
  multi-threaded. The biggest challenge in doing this will be figuring out how
  to use POSIX threads. The actual code in the thread is a relatively
  straight forward adaptation of of what you did in the previous section. Basically
  you will have the main body of code create the socket, do the bind, and the
  listen. The main body will then create a number of worker threads to handle 
the requests. The created threads will need the file descriptor to 
accept on. DO NOT USE A GLOBAL VARIABLE. For this assignment creating 4 threads will be sufficient. Once
  the worker threads have started the main thread has done all it needs to
  do. If you don't wait properly the main program can exit and take all the
  threads with it. You may to do a long sleep in a loop. 

</p><p>The body of the thread will contain or call  code to do the accept, parse
  the request, connect to the HTTP server, forward the request, and process the
  response. 

</p><p>As in part 1,  testing may be a challenge since you will want to slow things down a
  bit to have multiple requests being processed. Again doing things through
  telnet or with nc will be helpful.  At this point you might also want to configure a
  browser to use your server as a proxy. 



</p><h2>Part 4: Caching</h2>
<p>The real benefit of proxy server comes when it can return content that is has
  cached. For this assignment the caching rules are relatively simple. Any GET
  that returns a valid response is to be cached. You are to ignore any of the
  response fields that dictate whether or not content can be cached and for how
  long. Once a URI is cached, all subsequent requests to retrieve that URI are
  to return the cached contents. To keep things simple, one URI is considered to match another
  URI only if it matches exactly. 

</p><p>There are two big challenges with respect to caching:
</p><ol>
<li>How to locate the file containing the contents to be returned. You can't
  simply use the URI as the name of the file because URIs can contain "/" which
  has a special meaning in the Unix file system. There are a number of
  strategies you could employ such as using some sort of hash function on the
  name to produce a string to use as the name of the cache file. If you use
  this approach make sure you have a strategy for dealing with hash
  collisions. Another approach is to take the URI and convert it to an ASCII
  hex encoding of the file name which effectively gets rid of the special
  characters. Also keep in mind that a file name is restricted to a maximum of
  255 characters in length (i.e. within a directory no file can have more than
  255 characters) but a URI, or the converted representation of the URI could
  easily exceed this value so you will probably want to use some sort of radix
  based directory structure to store the files.
</li><li>Concurrent fetches of the same URI. Special care needs to be taken when a
  request comes in for a URI when a request to retrieve that URI is in
  progress. Since the first fetch of the URI is in progress the contents of the
  cache file are incomplete and cannot be returned. A simple way to deal with
  this is to use a temporary name for the file being fetched and then changing
  the name to the final name once the response has been fully received. If two
  clients request the same URI at the same time this will result in two fetches
  and two renames with the contents of the last rename replacing the older
  file.  
</li></ol>

<p>The Linux system call to rename a file is rename() (see man 2 rename). You
  are to store the cache files starting in a directory named cache. (You can
  have directories in the cache directory.) You are not to add the cache
  directory to your repo. If you commit any files in the cache directory you
  will be penalized 5 percent. If for some reason a cache file cannot be
  created, or a write to the file fails then the cache file is to be deleted,
  but the response from the server is still to be forwarded to the client. 
 
    </p><h2>Some Implementation Constraints, Suggestions and Reminders</h2>

    Your program must be named proxyFilter and take two arguments, the port the program will be
    listening on for HTTP requests and the name of the file storing the
    "inappropriate" strings to look for.  The program must not expect any input
    from standard
    input (i.e., typically the keyboard). There is no constraint related to the standard output, and
    it may be used as you wish, but you are warned to be careful if you print
    the 
    response body as it may contain binary data.

 <p>
    You are strongly advised to read section 4 of the RFC carefully,
    especially Section 4.4. You are required to handle the following
    types of message body length declarations: response codes that do
    not require bodies (e.g., 1xx or 304), chunked encoding, and 
    Content-Length header. As most of the web pages use the
    Content-Length header, it is  suggested  that you implement it first,
    followed by chunked encoding.

</p><p>    Keep in mind that for both the HTTP requests and responses that there is no
    constraint on how these messages get divided into the underlying network packets. A
    consequence of this is that you cannot assume that a single call to <em>
    recv()</em> will contain the complete response or request. The request or
    response data could span one or more <em> recv()</em> calls. You must take
    this behaviour into account when receiving a message. Although not as
    likely, it is also possible that a call to <em>send()</em> will not send
    the entire amount of data that the caller requested. Your code must be
    prepared for such behaviour and handle things appropriately. 

    
    
</p><p>
   </p><p> Although Linux and many other operating systems support IPv6 you are not
    required to deal with IPv6. Your program only needs to work in the standard 
    IPv4 environment. In addition you do not have to support HTTPS. 



 </p><p>
    You are not required to implement persistent HTTP connections, but
    keep in mind that the browser or the host may try to keep the
    connection alive. Consequently, you are not to expect a connection "EOF"
    to signal the end of a response. Conversely, you must 
    deal with unexpected connection interruptions which may not
    indicate the end of a response, but an error in the communication. If
    the web server closes the connection unexpectedly, you are
    required to send an appropriate response to the requestor,
    indicating that the request could not be correctly completed and 
    any data you might be writing to the cache file is to be deleted. Should 
    the requestor (client) close the connection unexpectedly, you are required
    to close all associated connections appropriately. 
    
    </p><p>
    Remember that a single request or response may require more than
    one TCP packet, so a simple <em>recv</em> command might not be
    sufficient to receive the entire request or response. Read the
    HTTP RFC or the appropriate chapters in the textbook to understand
    how to identify the end of the HTTP request or response. Also
    remember that a response may contain binary information, so a
    null byte does not necessarily represent the end of the response
    (i.e., do not use string functions
    like <em>strlen</em>, <em>strcpy</em> or <em>strcat</em> to deal
with any processing associated with determining the end of the HTTP response message body.)


    </p><p>Please keep in mind that what needs to be done is not terribly
    complicated if you approach it correctly. However, working with C and 
   strings in C can present its own set of problems but
      oftentimes, the simplest implementations and approaches are the best, so 
   don't make things complicated.

    </p><h2>What to Hand In</h2>

<ul>
      <li>All of the .c and .h files required to build proxyFilter.</li>
      <li>A makefile such that when the TA types <em>make</em> proxyFilter is built. The program must end
	up in the same directory where the makefile is (i.e., the home directory
	of your assignment.) Note, this does not have to be a complicated
	makefile and it is acceptable for the makefile to always rebuild the
	program regardless of whether or not they are out-of-date with respect
	to their source files. The provided makefile should only need minor
        modifications
   as you add additional .c or .h files</li>
      <li>Remember you hand in your assignment by committing the files and then
        pushing them to the stash server.
</li></ul>

    <h2>Grading Scheme</h2>
    Each portion will be graded taking the following into account:
    <p> Correctness</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Note that having a "working" assignment is not sufficient to
            guarantee full marks. To receive full marks the code must be
            reasonably structured, properly commented and use approaches and
            strategies that are appropriate to the problem being solved. Keep
            in mind that there are lots of ways to build a "bad" working
            program.
          </li></ul>

    <p>tyle and comments</p>

   <p>Grades will be apportioned roughly (i.e. things may not be exactly like
     this but it should be close) as follows:
</p><ol>
<li> 30% simple proxy server part
</li><li> 10% filtering part
</li><li> 25% multiple client support part
</li><li> 25% caching part
</li><li> miscelaneous things like comments, structure etc.
</li></ol>



    <p>YOUR CODE IS TO BE DEVELOPED FOR, AND RUN ON, THE UNDERGRADUATE Linux MACHINES.

      </p><p>Although it is possible to complete this assignment on a MAC or
        Windows machine you are strongly discouraged from doing so. There are significant differences in how
        to compile, link, and use sockets and threads  in these other environments that can
        make porting the resulting code to Linux particularly challenging and
        this might prevent you from being able to hand in a program that compiles,
        links, and produces an executable program, (which must happen if you want your
        assignment graded), let alone work.

    </p><h2>Time to Complete</h2>
  This assignment will take time not only to code, but to
    understand the HTTP specification and socket functionality. You
    are strongly advised to start implementing the assignment as early
    as possible. As a general rule, if you are stuck on the same
    problem for more than one or two hours, you should 
    seek help or guidance on how to proceed.
